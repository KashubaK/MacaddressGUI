Stable release of the Powershell API.
Currently it does one thing, and that is entering Mac Addresses. 
I am lead to believe that the interface is bug-free. If any bugs are found, just post them on Yammer or whatever.
This file will be some sort of record for new changes, something like that.
Anywho.

Neat interface for entering Mac Addresses.

Next step(s) - Update method, execute remote commands, ask brandon what he wants (again)
