# PowershellAPI
Node js API for executing common Powershell tasks

##API Usage

- Send powershell commands to a list or ou of windows devices `(server/sendWindowsCommand)`
  - Send a post request to the server on the url /sendWindowsCommand.
  - You'll need to send one array named commands, one named computers. Each command will be sent to each computer.
    - If you want to send an ou, or group of ous, list the ous in the computers array instead, and also send ou = true.
  - The server may take a long time to respond (depending on what you asked it to do), so be sure to adjust your http timeout up as needed.
  - Once the job has been completed, the server responds with a json array detailing the computer name, the assumed location, the time it took to send the command, and the response generated by executing the command.
